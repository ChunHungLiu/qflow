Default technology uses OSU open source digital cell libraries
See http://vlsiarch.ecen.okstate.edu/flows/
---------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and install:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See full instructions on http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/

The ./configure needs arguments for each tool of the tool
chain that is not in the standard search path.  Qflow will
need to be able to find the following tools:

	sis
	TimberWolf
	qrouter
	magic

and one or more of the following:

	vis
	odin-ii

All tools except TimberWolf and odin-ii typically install in a
standard location that is in the normal user path.  TimberWolf
typically compiles into its own source path, and odin-ii may
either do the same, or it may be compiled as part of the tool
set "vtr".

--------------------------------------------------------------
"qflow" is the original verilog digital flow from
opencircuitdesign, reorganized for the following reasons:

(1) All the technology-independent scripts and programs can
    be organized in one place, and not be copied for every
    project.

(2) All the technology-dependent files can be organized
    under a single tech directory, with the technology
    specified on the command-line, or even pulled from a
    file in the layout directory.

(3) Various working directories can be reassigned by
    setting environment variables

(4) The C source code files can be compiled under a standard
    "make" process

(5) The compile and install process can be put under gnu
    automake/autoconf.

(6) The location of external programs (qrouter and TimberWolf)
    can be searched for by autoconf, or passed as arguments
    to the configure script

(7) Should make it easy to switch between verilog compilers
    (i.e., vis/sis vs. odinII/sis, maybe others eventually)

(8) Try to convert and handle all files in standard formats:
    mainly RTL verilog, LEF, and DEF.
   
(9) Consolidate all configuration information into a single
    config file that can call out each tool or tools for
    which the configuration information applies, much like
    TimberWolf does, except extended to include the other
    tools in qflow.
